              <p></p>

              <p>"EPA UNEPSA denounces any conflicts or other military actions including war and its devastating impact on the lives of children, adolescents and their
                families. We are extremely concerned about the health, wellbeing and safety of all children living in Ukraine during the current crisis. We call on our
                member societies to make every effort possible to protect and support the health and wellbeing of children living in Ukraine including those who are
                now seeking refuge in other countries.
                We also share our concern for all our colleagues and particularly those in the midst of these very challenging times. We urge all member societies and
                organizations to work together and speak with one voice in order to successfully advocate for the health and wellbeing of European children.
                We sincerely hope that peaceful negotiations will help end this war and needless suffering as soon as possible."</p>
